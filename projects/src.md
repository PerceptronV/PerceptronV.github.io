Duality - _A smart, UV-sterilising Phone Case_

<img src="static/phonecase.png" alt="Phonecase" width="100%" height="auto"/>

> Together with several teammates from HKAGE, we propose a design for a smart UV-sterilizing phone case. With the pandemic in mind, we decided to offer an alternative to alcohol-based sterilization, which often harms your phone, hence the idea of UV sterilization. To go a step further, we also took up the challenge of preventing dropping phones, envisioning an AI system which can predict the possibility of the phone falling based on accelerometer inputs, notifying the user when that possibility is dangerously high. Along the way, we also added other helpful functions, such as a warming pad to prevent the user's phone shutting down in cold weather.
>
> A full overview of functions, designs, and specifications can be found in [this presentation](static/Duality.pdf). Please note that this is just a prototype concept.

浪淘沙

> This is a project I've been working on for a few months now. It aims at generating coherent, rhyming traditional Chinese poetry, based on an encoder-decoder architecture with attention.
>
> Here is a sample generation:
>
> 引笛梅花落，韓將浮水清。
> 却立看城柳，豈不愛蓬萊。
>
> Note that it doesn't yet possess properties of rhyme and rhythm, and that's what I'm working towards.

Teens Speak Out

> This is an attempt at running a blog to spread the voice of teenagers. It was founded by one of my friends, and I'm one of its main editors. It is based on an earlier blog of similar nature (<a href='https://lockdownblog.org'>Teens On Lockdown</a>), although this earlier blog was mainly targeted at pandemic.

Project Leventis

> With several friends at Harrow School, we are developing a VR racing car experience with Oculus Quest.

[ 08/2020 ]:		Volunteer Teaching

> This is a community-service programme that I initiated in response to the pandemic. I really wanted to help children learn better and bring them joy in these difficult times, hoping to lessen the impact of the pandemic on the academic life of primary-school children. Therefore, I formed a team together with some of my friends, and volunteered to teach English.
>
> We had to look for multiple organisations before one offered to help us reach out for interested primary school children. Even though this is nothing big and in the end, only a few kids applied, we still found it meaningful to have left an impact during COVID-19.

[ 05/2020 ]:		Arspiration - _Generating Abstract Art with DCGAN_

<img src="static/abstractart.png" alt="Abstract Art" width="100%" height="auto"/>

> I used one of the generated artwork to enter an art competition at my school. Although I didn't win it, my 'artwork' received positive comments from the kind judge, who said '*This is a very poetic abstract work that brings so many art historical references to mind from Monet to Richter*'.

[ 04/2020 ]:		Forecasting Coronavirus Cases - _Using time series forecasting to predict the number of COVID cases_

<img src="static/covidcases.png" alt="Predicted-ground-truth-plot" width="100%" height="auto"/>

> In response to the pandemic, I decided to test how AI might help. So I developed a system which predicts the number of coronavirus cases tomorrow based on a 7-day history. As you see, the true and predicted values match up quite closely!
>
> Although this may seem successful, I believe the daily growth of COVID cases is due to a myriad of factors, such that no AI system of the scale this project can predict cases sufficiently well. Therefore, this is far from commercially useable; but it could be a good start.

[ 02/2020 ]: 		Polaris (My Shell Project) - _Assistant for the isolated elderly_

This video below shows Polaris in action! 👇

> A smart friend aimed at helping the elderly, Polaris is a product which stems from the observation that populations worldwide are slowly aging.
>
> With more elderly in the society, and a lot of them living alone in Asian countries, their safety becomes a major concern. That's why, I developed Polaris so that it listens out for the elderly, using a custom Recurrent Neural Network to classify if they're asking for help (e.g. saying 'save me please'). This then triggers a warning on my online database, which when deployed, can notify local emergency services.
>
> Other than that, Polaris is just like a personal assistant, but very friendly. It reminds you to wear more if it's cold, performs facial detection and recognition to greet you, etc.
>
> Note: I won my school's Shell Project competition with this project, Polaris. To see an overview of its functions and the ideas behind its conception and design, please refer to my [Polaris Presentation](static/polaris-presentation.pdf).
>
> This work shows the growth in my understanding in AI under just a few months. Prior to the completion of my research below, I was still struggling to write a full deep learning program in all its entirety: from data acquiring and processing, via model building and loss function defining, to the final training and testing itself.
>
> But during the project, a lot of the programs were very original, especially the core AI, which understands who you're talking to as well as what you're talking about. This shows that I have some good experience with the field, and am capable of picking things up in a short time.

[ 12/2019 ]: 		HaikuGAN - _Research projects with Prof. LEE Tan, CUHK_

> In my work, directed by Professor Tan Lee at CUHK, I discussed and explored several approaches at generating haiku poetry in deep learning.
>
> Through experimentation, I pointed out the inherent problems in each, and then set out to solve some of these problems by combining different methods in haiku generation. In my newly proposed training method, some old problems were resolved.
>
> My [final report](Vincent-Song-TECS3461-Report), of course, wasn't really a pioneering work of insightful breakthroughs, because I have only became acquainted with machine learning for less than a year at the time of writing. I did spend more than thirty hours on it in total, though, and I hope that there are still some fresh ideas. I did almost all of the research and learning behind the report on my own as well, and at the same time I also taught myself calculus, which proved very helpful.
>
> If not talent, I hope this work shows my motivation, ambition and zeal in conducting research on machine learning, as well as my ability to learn new topics entirely by myself. It also demonstrates my hands on ability to fiddle with these ideas practically in coding, that I won't just learn them as dead concepts, but will instead combine and experiment with them.

[ 06/2019 ]: 		Project LAWS - _Automatic Watering System_

<img src="static/LAWS.jpg" alt="Project LAWS" width="100%" height="auto"/>

> With Project LAWS (Leaf Automatic Watering System), you never have to manually water your plants again.
>
> After realizing that nobody bothered to water our class plant (wittily named Leaf Junior) at St.Paul's Co-Educational College, I decided to make an automatic watering system together with a friend.
