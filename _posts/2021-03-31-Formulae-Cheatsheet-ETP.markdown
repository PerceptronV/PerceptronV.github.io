excerpt: A sneaky preview at my new formulae cheatsheet, under-construction.
---

This is a blog post about formulae, and giant formulae cheatsheets.

Ok. Here's the story. While preparing for various physics challenges, I decided to concentrate all the important physics formulae I know of into one single, massive Latex file on Overleaf - the *Physics Formulae Cheatsheet*. It soon extended to incorporate some important math prerequisites. And since I'm currently learning about complex numbers, ironically, this section quickly grew much fatter than its physics counterpart. The current version of the cheatsheet I'm working on is named, aptly, as *Elemental Topaz*.

Right know, the formulae cheatsheet does cover a lot of useful topics, but it's definitely lacking in electromagnetism, not to mention quantum mechanics and relativity. My plan is to focus on classical mechanics for now and enrich these sections in the future. 

The cheatsheet is very much still in its cradle phase and not complete yet - there's still loads of missing stuff and empty headers. But even though it may not be very comprehensive, I hope it will be one day. So stay tuned! **And if you'd like to collaborate on Overleaf, please do [contact me]({{ site.baseurl }}/#contact-me)!**

Anyway, without further ado - here's my *Physics Formulae Cheatsheet - version Elemental Topaz*.
