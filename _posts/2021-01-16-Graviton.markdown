We've all been there. You're panting, sweat dripping, triceps burning, struggling, for some unknown reason, to lift your body up for one, more, painful, time...

Then the big problem comes: just, exactly how many reps did I do?

Because somehow those numbers matter.

It's annoying, but tech can make life easier. Using Tensorflow.js's [PoseNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet), I've implemented a basic push-up counter called __Graviton__, which runs only on a browser. No servers involved, so your data is safe.

Graviton tracks your key body locations, and uses their relative positioning to identify whether or not you've completed a rep. To start off, simply set the number of reps you want to do, turn on the counter, and it will beep every time you complete a rep. Once you finish the desired number of reps, there will be another acoustic cue.
