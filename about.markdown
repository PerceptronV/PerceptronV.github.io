# About me

Aside from ploughing daily in a land of Pandas Dataframes, littered with badly-named GitHub commits and leading towards a never-ending list of things to learn, he sometimes descends into the peaceful lands of physics and math, poetry and philosophy, Latin et Espa√±ol.

For him, there is nothing cooler than the precise understanding of nature and the changes he can make in the everyday.

For this reason, if he were to study two subjects for the rest of his life, it would be physics and computer science. Physics models everything so perfectly with numbers, while computer science and technology as a whole, makes a difference to every single one of us. They give him amazing powers to understand and create, to help and change, and these are his aspirations.

That being said, Vincent believes that diversity gives rise to solutions, because diversity means change, and change means difference. Although keeping a main focus on STEM, specifically deep learning and physics, he has many far-flung interests, from literature to computer science, via physics to cute bears. Connecting different dots give new ideas, which in turn promote diversity, so he thinks it doesn't hurt to have more interests!
