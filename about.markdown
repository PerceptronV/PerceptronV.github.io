I am a freshman at Harvard College, planning to pursue a joint concentration in CS and Physics / Maths. My long-term goal is to build explainable and scalable machine learning systems for scientific discovery.

I have previously:
* Developed multimodal language models to interface with scientific data, under the mentorship of [Dr Siddharth Mishra-Sharma](https://www.smsharma.io/) and [Prof Jesse Thaler](https://jthaler.net/) at [IAIFI](https://iaifi.org/), MIT (as part of [Research Science Institute](https://www.cee.org/programs/research-science-institute)).
* Led research on the [large-scale graph structure of Wikipedia links](https://github.com/harrow-turing-2022/wisteria-core), culminating in a first author [publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229390/).
* Investigated using [autoencoders for low-resource machine translation](https://bit.ly/ysong-low-resc-nmt-new) under Dr Alifierakis at [Global Talent Mentoring](https://globaltalentmentoring.org/).

Outside of research, I like making stuff because it's fun. I started [Team Enigma](https://github.com/Harrow-Enigma), leading the development of an [AI-powered acoustic monitoring device for environmental conservation](https://github.com/agouti-acoustics/into-the-wild-resources) and prototyping a [facial recognition system for registration in my boarding school](https://github.com/Harrow-Enigma/TECLARS). In NLP, I've experimented with automatic Haiku and traditional Chinese poetry generation, as well as [finetuning GPT-2 to write for my school's newspaper](https://github.com/PerceptronV/HarrovAI). 

I also enjoy doodling with programming languages and built a [pseudocode-to-Python transpiler](https://github.com/PerceptronV/dudocode) completely from scratch, making it *actually possible* to run the [pseudocode in my school curriculum](https://github.com/PerceptronV/dudocode/blob/main/pseudocode_specification.pdf). I also developed a [novel tool to simulate a C++ interpreter](https://github.com/PerceptronV/scierra) on top of an existing GCC installation.

Currently, I'm interested in 1) building models that align astronomical observations across modalities, and 2) from a cognitive science standpoint, building neural networks that can recursively form and operate on abstractions.

At college and beyond, I hope to: 1) build a sound understanding of how and why ML models work in controllable contexts, using tools from physics, cognitive sciences, mechanistic interpretability, or elsewhere; 2) use this knowledge to develop systems with explicit reasoning, better interpretability, and less supervision. 

My other interests include learning ancient languages, exploring art, creative writing, photography, and philosophy. I have experimented with constructing my own language. I enjoy climbing, camping, and hiking.
