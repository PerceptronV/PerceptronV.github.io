I like technology because it controls the pulse of our rapid world. 

Specifically, I enjoy learning about and applying machine learning concepts to realworld problems, like predicting exchange rates, generating poetry, or making personal assistants. Playing around with Arduinos is always cool, too!

Despite the long hours in front of a computer screen catching the bugs and decreasing the loss (made bearable by my special taste of music), these projects added excitement to holidays and school life. 

It also doesn't hurt to learn some physics - perhaps one day AI will be our best tool for solving quantum gravity. 

Aside from ploughing through fields of Pandas dataframes and scary integrals, I sometimes descend into the peaceful lands of poetry and philosophy. Some of my previous work have been published at Balloons Lit. Journal, and I'll be presenting a paper on consciousness in the upcoming Merchant Taylors' School Young Philosophers Conference!

When I have time, I also like learning _Espa√±ol_ and Latin. 

That's quite a lot of stuff, but hopefully one day all the dots will connect. 

At school, I've delivered lectures to the Drone Society, Science society, Junior Gore Society (philosophy), and Math Society, while I'm also a regular at Marmots Club (rock climbing), Debating Society, and the Boy's IT Committee. On top of these, I am in the process of founding an AI-centred team - Team Enigma.
