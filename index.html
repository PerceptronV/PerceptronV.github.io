            <h1>About me</h1>
            
            <h2>A Brief Intro</h2>
            <p class='text'>Vincent Song is a STEM enthusiast who also loves philosophy and poetry.</p>
            <p class='text'>He believes that diversity gives rise to solutions, because diversity means change, and change means difference. Although keeping a main focus on STEM, specifically deep learning and physics, he has many far-flung interests, from literature to computer science. Connecting different dots give new ideas, which in turn promote diversity, so he thinks it doesn't hurt to have more interests!</p>
            
            <h2>What I Love</h2>
            <p class='text'>Vincent is especially passionate about deep learning and has had previous experience of doing NLP-related research guided by <a href='https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html' class='norm_link'>CUHK</a> professor Tan Lee; he believes AI is one of the most promising tools driving us forward. Vincent also has an interest in immersive technologies and likes getting his hands dirty on Arduino-based projects. As a pastime, he is currently developing touch-free technologies with Arduino boards and plans to enter his project in the worldwide <a href='https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/contests/touchlessdomore' class='norm_link'>Arduino Touch Less Do More Challenge</a>. (<a href='projects' class='norm_link'>See: Projects</a>)</p>
            <p class='text'>Vincent loves math and all sciences as well, especially physics. Recently, he has pitched a short video explaining the 'Principle of Least Action' to the <a href='https://breakthroughjuniorchallenge.org/' class='norm_link'>Breakthrough Junior Challenge</a>. He was a finalist together with his teammates at the UK Royal Society of Chemistry's <a href='https://edu.rsc.org/enrichment/top-of-the-bench' class='norm_link'>Top of the Bench</a> competition last academic year. (<a href='achievements' class='norm_link'>See: CV & Achievements</a>)</p>
            <p class='text'>When Vincent is not doing STEM-related work, he likes to write poetry. His work has previously appeared on <a href='https://www.balloons-lit-journal.com/' class='norm_link'>Balloons Lit. Journal</a> and he is a past winner of the <a href='https://hkage.org.hk/hkbpa/index.php' class='norm_link'>Hong Kong Budding Poets Award</a>.</p>
            <p class='text'>'Interstellar' is his favourite film; 'A Hundred Years of Solitude' is his favourite book.</p>
            
            <h2>Education & Future Stuff</h2>
            <p class='text'>Vincent plans on majoring in computer science or physics at university, undertaking fundamental research and see how they might complement each other. After uni, he'd like to start his own research-based company. All this is tentative, though, so only time will tell.</p>
            <p class='text'>He has recently looked into democratizing tech, and he plans on starting an education project when he goes back to school in September, using block-based programming to teach kids basic ML.</p>
            <p class='text'>Vincent currently studies at <a href='https://www.harrowschool.org.uk/' class='norm_link'>Harrow School UK</a>, where he is part of many STEM-related projects and societies, like Project Leventis, which aims at assembling a VR Car Simulation from scratch.</p>
